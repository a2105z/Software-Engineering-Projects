Atlas Database Migrations
=========================

This folder contains Alembic migrations for the Atlas database schema.

To run migrations (from backend/ directory):
  python -m alembic upgrade head

Or migrations run automatically when the app starts.

To create a new migration (after changing models):
  python -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

To downgrade one revision:
  python -m alembic downgrade -1
